This web application classifies the degradation state of polymers using **Raman and FTIR spectroscopy** and deep learning.
It is a prototype pipeline for evaluating multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on spectral data.

## üß≠ How to Use

The application provides three main analysis modes in a tabbed interface:

1. **Standard Analysis**:

   - Upload a single spectrum file (`.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`) or a batch of files.
   - Choose a model from the sidebar.
   - Run analysis and view the prediction, confidence, and technical details.

2. **Model Comparison**:

   - Upload a single spectrum file.
   - The app runs inference with all available models.
   - View a side-by-side comparison of the models' predictions and performance.

3. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Explore a dashboard with visualizations of historical performance data.
   - Compare model performance across different metrics.
   - Export performance data in CSV or JSON format.

### Supported Input

- Plaintext `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.json` files.
- Data can be space-, comma-, or tab-separated.
- Comment lines (`#`, `%`) are ignored.
- The app automatically detects the file format and resamples the data to a standard length.

## üöÄ Technical Architecture

**The system is built on a modular, production-ready architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.**

- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based web application (`app.py`) with interactive, multi-tab UI.
- **Backend**: PyTorch for deep learning operations including model loading and inference.
- **Model Management**: Registry pattern (`models/registry.py`) for dynamic model loading and easy integration of new architectures.
- **Data Processing**: Modality-aware preprocessing pipeline (`utils/preprocessing.py`) for data integrity and standardization (Raman & FTIR).
- **Multi-Format Parsing**: `utils/multifile.py` for parsing `.txt`, `.csv`, and `.json` files.
- **Results Management**: `utils/results_manager.py` for managing session and persistent results, multi-model comparison, and data export.
- **Performance Tracking**: `utils/performance_tracker.py` logs metrics to SQLite and powers the dashboard.
- **Deployment**: Containerized via Docker (`Dockerfile`) for reproducible, cross-platform execution.
