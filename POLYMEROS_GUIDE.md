- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Bayesian approaches for robust confidence estimation

#### 2. Materials Science Data Handling

- **Contextual Knowledge Networks**: Data structures that preserve scientific context and relationships
- **Intelligent Metadata Management**: Automatic extraction and tracking of experimental conditions
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Physics-informed augmentation for limited dataset scenarios
- **Version Control for Science**: Complete provenance tracking for reproducibility

#### 3. Educational Tools for Knowledge Building
